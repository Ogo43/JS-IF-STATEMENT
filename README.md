ðŸ§¾ Age-Based Login Redirect (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This is a simple web page that prompts the user to enter their age when they click the Login button. Based on the age entered, the user is redirected to either an adult.html page or a kids.html page.

ðŸš€ How It Works
The user fills in their email and password on the index.html form.

When the Login button is clicked:

A prompt asks for the user's age.

If the user enters a valid age:

If age is 18 or older, they are redirected to adult.html.

If age is under 18, they are redirected to kids.html.

If no input is entered or input is invalid, an alert appears asking for a valid age.
